# Flask React
This is a docker container for flask and react.

To use pull the repository and open the repository directory, then run this command: 
```shell
mkdir dist ; docker-compose up
```

# Dist folder
I noticed that the docker-compose up command requires a `dist` directory and isn't being created in the Dockerfile. A fix is in the works.
